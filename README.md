## Overview
The AntiCheat plugin for Minecraft is designed to enhance server security by detecting and preventing common hacks, cheats, and exploits. This plugin is built for Paper/Spigot and offers a variety of detection mechanisms, including anti-killaura, anti-fly, anti-speed, anti-autoclicker, and more. It helps maintain a fair gaming environment by notifying admins of suspicious activity and taking action against offenders.

- **Anti-Killaura Detection**: Detects players dealing excessive damage.
- **Anti-Speed Detection**: Identifies players moving faster than allowed.
- **Anti-AutoClicker Detection**: Monitors for excessively rapid clicking.
- **Anti-NoFall Detection**: Detects players who do not take fall damage.
- **Anti-XRay Detection**: Monitors abnormal mining patterns.

  # This prevents players from moving too quickly in rapid succession (default is 80ms).
  minTimeBetweenMoves: 80


# Anti fly hack config
flyDetectionThreshold: 5000 # Threshold for fly detection (in milliseconds)

#Anti auto-clicker hack config
clickTimeThreshold: 150 #time old for click detection (in milliseconds)
maxClicksPerSecond: 15 #maximum clicks allowed per second

# Anti NoFall hack config
# NoFall AntiCheat Configuration
maxFallDistance: 4.0 # The maximum fall distance a player can fall before triggering NoFall detection.
noFallResetTime: 5000 # The time after a fall that NoFall detection resets, in milliseconds.
expectedFallDamage: 2.0 # The expected fall damage when no hacks are being used.

# XRay Detection config
xray:
  timeWindow: 180000  # Time window (in milliseconds) to analyze mining patterns (default: 60 seconds)

  maxHitsInTimeFrame: 3 # Allowable hits in a timeframe (milliseconds)
  hitsTimeFrame: 1000 # Timeframe in milliseconds
  maxAttackAngle: 60.0 # Maximum angle allowed for an attack (in degrees)
  multiHitThreshold: 100 # Threshold for multi-entity hits (in milliseconds)
  maxReach: 4.0 # Maximum reach distance for player attacks (in blocks)
